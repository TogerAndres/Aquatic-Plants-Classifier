# 🌿 Project Impact – Aquatic Plants Classifier

This repository contains the development of an **image classification model** for identifying **invasive aquatic plants** using TensorFlow and EfficientNetB0, as part of **Project Impact**.

---

## 📝 **Project Description**

The goal is to classify four species of aquatic plants:

1. **Common Duckweeds (*Lemna minor*)**
2. **Common Water Hyacinth (*Eichornia crassipes*)**
3. **Heartleaf False Pickerelweed (*Monochoria korsakowii*)**
4. **Water Lettuce (*Pistia stratiotes*)**

Currently implemented:

✅ Training with EfficientNetB0  
✅ Fine-tuning and metrics comparison  
✅ Verification scripts and confidence analysis reports  
✅ Generation of accuracy and loss graphs
